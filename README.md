Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave) or stay with a business using Machine Learning models.  
It is designed to help businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive steps to improve retention.

Overview
Customer churn is a major concern for subscription-based and service-oriented businesses.  
This project uses machine learning to predict churn based on customer behavior and account details.


Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
- Machine Learning model training (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).
- Prediction of customer churn: Churn = 1 (Yes), Churn = 0 (No).
- Easy-to-use interface (Streamlit app / Jupyter Notebook).


Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Visual Studio Code (for analysis and prototyping)
- Streamlit (for interactive web app, optional)
- GitHub (for version control)


Dataset
The project uses a Bank Customer Churn Dataset with features like:
- `CustomerId`, `CreditScore`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `Balance`, `Products`, `HasCrCard`, `IsActiveMember`, `EstimatedSalary`

Target variable:
- `Exited` → `1 = Churn`, `0 = Stay`

*(Dataset can be replaced with any churn dataset relevant to your use case.)*


Project Workflow
1. Data Collection → Load dataset (CSV/Database).  
2. Preprocessing → Clean, encode categorical features, scale numeric features.  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Understand patterns, correlations.  
4. Model Training → Train ML models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.).  
5. Evaluation → Accuracy, Precision, F1-score, etc.  
6. Prediction → Classify customers as churn or not churn.  


Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
Launch the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py


Results
Best performing model: Random Forest
Accuracy: ~85% (example)
Can be improved with hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.


Future Improvements
Add deep learning models (ANN, LSTM for time-series churn).
Deploy as a full web application with Flask/Django.
Real-time churn prediction with API integration.
