**1. Abstract**
The goal of this project is to develop a customer churn prediction system for a bank using machine learning techniques. The system predicts whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) or remain based on features such as credit score, age, account balance, tenure, and other demographic and transactional data. It uses a Random Forest Classifier, trained on historical customer data, to predict churn with high accuracy.

The final product is a web application built with Streamlit. Bank employees can input customer data into a simple form and receive an instant prediction. The app processes the input, transforms the data, and uses the trained model to generate results in real-time, offering actionable insights to improve customer retention.

**1. Introduction**
1.1 Motivation
The banking industry experiences significant customer turnover, leading to revenue losses. There is a growing need for predictive tools to identify at-risk customers early.

1.2 Problem Definition
To build a tool that predicts customer churn using historical banking data.

1.3 Objective
Develop a machine learning model with a user-friendly web interface to predict customer churn.

1.4 Limitations
The system may require periodic retraining and does not explain the reason for churn.

1.5 Uniqueness
The project offers a simple, interpretable, and affordable solution using open-source tools.
